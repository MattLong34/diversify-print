            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Born out of the many travesties of 2020, Diversify Print came from the desire to see more voices in print, to change the way the average bookshelf looks and to launch writer’s into a successful career as authors. 
                
                <p>We are here to serve the voices unheard and to empower each individual with the knowledge and skills to be successful in sharing their stories.</p> 

                <p>Through personalized plans, writing coaching and marketing training we will develop what you want your publishing journey to look like. 
                
                We are committed to developing and empowering new writers, unique perspectives and most of all, diverse voices.</p> 
                
                <p>Founder Katie Long hopes to join you on this journey. With an undergraduate degree in Professional Writing and seven years of publishing experience, she will walk alongside you through all aspects of the life of a manuscript and writer.</p> 
                
                <p>Katie started off her post-college work as a children’s librarian and her publishing career began in editorial, moved into marketing and acquisitions and is now leading a team at a Christian publishing house.
                
                Originally from Indiana, she now lives with her husband, son and two cats in Colorado, trying to get as close to the mountains as possible.</p>
