            <h2><strong>Alysia Brown</strong></h2>
            <p>Alysia is a comedian, a master music mixer and a writer.  
              
              <br><br>As one of Diversify Print’s first clients, Alysia came to Diversify Print with an idea for a book and a desire to dive into building her brand in a new way.  
              
              <br><br>We worked together to create an outline of her ideas, draft some initial work and narrow down what ways she would like to write. Her biggest goal was to start writing and not let her idea disappear, and we focused on how to fit in writing with a busy schedule and how to manage goals with career expectations. 
              
              <br><br>"<strong>I’m so grateful for the guidance Katie gave me. </strong>Initially our main goal was to finish the book by the end of 2021, but as we worked through my desires and goals, we’re now transitioning into something that will help excel my career! Diversity Print has helped me get my ducks in a row. It has helped me gain the confidence I needed to pursue my desired career.”  
              
              <br><br>As Alysia continues to commit to her professional goals, Diversify Print walks alongside her to help her focus, inspire her and continue to build her brand!  
              
              <br><br>“You should work with Diversify Print because <strong>Katie’s determination will make you want to work hard, inspire you, and help you complete any project you’re working on.</strong>”

              <h2><strong>Kim Levings</strong></h2>
              <p>Kim is a writer, leadership coach, world speaker and business owner.  
                
                <br><br>She had a book near completion and was ready to begin pursuing agents and editors when she began working with Diversify Print. We set goals to have her resource published and are working together to prepare to present proposals to publishers, successfully land a publisher, and have subsequent publicity planned.  
                
                <br><br>Kim’s favorite thing about working with Diversify Print is her relationship with Katie.  
                
                <br><br>“She’s really good at what she does and is very easy to work with. <strong>Katie’s understanding of publishing and how to smooth the proposal process has been the most helpful thing as we’ve worked together.</strong> It’s been a great experience because of her qualifications and knowledge.”

                <h2><strong>Natasha Dongell</strong></h2>
                <p>Natasha is a pastor, writer, professor and musician.  
                  
                  <br><br>A majority of her manuscript was written and she had big dreams for it, but no clear path toward publishing. With goals like writing several resources for the Church, working with people who would help her get better at her craft and being a part of a publishing company or team that would believe in her vision and come alongside her in her calling, we worked together to set realistic timelines and tasks that fit in with her schedule and career calling.  
                  
                  <br><br>“<strong>Katie helped me carve out a timeline with important next steps toward publishing and marketing my first book.</strong> She created a shared document with all the needed information and met with me every other week to touch base on progress and stay on track. She understood the creative process and balanced those nuances well with the set milestones and deadlines on the calendar and encouraged me in the difficult, busy times while holding me accountable to our overall goals.”  
                  
                  <br><br>Natasha’s favorite thing about working with Diversify Print has been the support during the creating and selling process.  
                  
                  <br><br>“<strong>Katie got to know me personally and understood my wiring as a creator.  She took on the role of managing the timeline so I could focus on the task of writing. </strong> Knowing that she was guiding the timeline at just the right pace for me brought so much relief! Katie also provided templates for things like proposals and back cover copy, a special submission needed for a writing conference. She edited my manuscript to the format publishers prefer to read. Her knowledge in these areas made it easy to provide something I knew I could be proud of and promote to others. <strong>In such a friendly way, she is helping me become a professional writer with integrity, respect and the confidence to succeed!</strong>” 
                  
                  <br><br>Writing a book is hard and scary! Bridging the gap between a lone writer with big dreams to actually putting your book into the hands of a publisher and seeing results; that’s where a lot of writers get lost.  
                  
                  <br><br>Katie, a writer herself, understands the nuances of creating a book. She offers relational support, guidance and even training when appropriate for the writing journey.  Beyond that, her value extends to the knowledge and network she carries throughout the publishing world! <strong>She offers a clear sturdy bridge to get across the wide gap of lone dreaming to a successful book launch.</strong>   
                  
                  <br><br>“I am so grateful for her. I know you will be, too!”

                  <img class="testimonial-image" src="/assets/Christine Greenwald.png" alt="Christine Greenwald image" align="left">
                  <h2><strong>Christine Greenwald</strong></h2>
                  <p>Christine is a licensed therapist, avid blogger and book reviewer.  
                    
                    <br><br>Christine was nearly done with her manuscript and looking at places to submit a proposal to while trying to figure out if she wanted to go with an agent or submit directly to a small publisher. She was feeling overwhelmed with the process of how to get her book into the world and didn’t know how likely it might be that an agent or publisher would be willing to pick it up. <strong>Crossing that divide to get the book into the real world was daunting.</strong> 
                    
                    <br><br>As we met and reviewed the manuscript, our main goal was to focus on developing Christine’s platform and putting together a solid proposal to catch publishers’ attention. We also wanted to make sure her manuscript was in good condition and looked professional.   
                    
                    <br><br>We created a consistent blogging schedule and discussed the importance of using social media in ways that felt natural, while continuing to work on the manuscript. We also created goals about getting the writing in top condition so it would be ready for publishers to look at and worked on putting together a proposal. Through all of this, Christine has been able to stick to a consistent blogging schedule for the first time ever with the help of accountability and is learning a lot about the modern art of authorship and the various things that go into it!  
                    
                    <br><br>Christine’s favorite thing about working with Diversify Print is that Katie is familiar with the publishing industry and has a passion for getting new writers into the business who would often struggle to break through those barriers themselves. Katie is passionate about getting new voices heard and trying to help new writers overcome barriers to entry. Her strong, determined, fierce personality is a great match for introverted writers like Christine, who tend to downplay themselves and struggle to promote themselves and their writing.  
                    
                    <br><br>“I really like that Katie is organized and methodical. She has helped create timelines that allow me to flourish – I do better with schedules and “deadlines,” but I don’t always implement them of my own volition! <strong>When I was working on my book by myself, I often felt like I was meandering</strong>, not entirely sure what next step I needed to take but wanting to do something. <strong>Now that I’m working with Katie, we have a plan and I know the next steps I need to take to achieve my goals.</strong> It feels great! I feel like my brain and my writing have been able to thrive under Katie’s organized guidance. The value of that, for me, can’t be overstated.” 
                    
                    <br><br>While working with Diversify Print, Christine had to navigate a very sticky situation while seeking permission / consent for her book. She found it incredibly stressful and didn’t know what to do, but after meeting with Katie shortly after this situation arose, she had a renewed perspective on things and felt positive and confident about their way forward.  
                    
                    <br><br>“Without Katie’s support, I don’t know what I would have done in this situation! She continues to look out for my best interest as a writer, my publishing prospects and interests, while being cognizant of some of the challenges we will inevitably face along the way. If you are passionate about writing or have dreams about authorship that you know you could use support in achieving; if you know you have talent but you lack connections and know-how about publishing; or if you are looking for someone to serve as advisor and coach in your writing and publishing process – Katie is a great person for the job!”
